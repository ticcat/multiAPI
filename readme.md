First web project to learn the basis of raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript(ES6).

As most first web projects, the objective was to learn how to fetch data from free-to-use APIs, parse and show the results, but this time with a twist on usability and looks. I focused on not to offer just a search bar for a single API, but to have on top of that a more usable kind of navigation and host access to at least two different free APIs of the kind.

The project ended up being more complex than I anticipated, hence it created more trouble than I thought and needed more time to complete. But either way, it also came out better than expected! I have faced new challenges and learned along the way, as you may see if you dig a bit thourgh the code. As I was learning during the development, first-time custom elements (components) such as endpoint-card only share the bases with other more complex such as the search-bar, which has its own states, fetches data and uses events to communicate with other components/modules. One of the focuses was to use custom elements as components, with their own behavior and reusability. 

Other focus was the design and UX, trying to offer the best usability and responsivness (I wouldn't reccommend the page to be use on mobiles, since desktop is the main platform of choice this time). In order to improve that UX I mentioned I concentrated in three main areas:
  1. Making the UI as simple and clear as possible
  2. Adding organic animations to the navigation.
  3. 3.Blocking the user inputs as little as I could.
